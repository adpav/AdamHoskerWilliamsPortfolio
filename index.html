<!-- At EMIS, my current focus is on improving user interfaces within the healthcare sector. With expertise in both responsive and creative web and app design, I prioritize designing user interfaces that are both visually appealing and easy to use.

My extensive experience working with clients across various industries and products has provided me with a deep understanding of design principles and best practices, which has allowed me to create designs that are highly functional and effective.

Alongside my design skills, I have expanded my proficiency to include semantic HTML and CSS. My ability to utilize these techniques is evident in the creation of this website, which is optimized for speed, accessibility, and usability.

As someone with a graphic design background, I also express my creative side through minimalist digital artworks that I sell under the pseudonym Petit Panther. This artistic pursuit enables me to explore different aspects of creativity and design and remain motivated and inspired in my work. -->

For the system to be a success and to enable designers and developers to work more efficiently, a core principle I like to stick to is in keeping the system as flexible as possible. The more complex the components become, the more rigid they can become - this can result in components which are too specific to be scaleable across scenarios. My knowledge of HTML and CSS means I can bridge the gap in conversations between designers and developers at the heart of the system and craft a language that can help maintain consistency and cohesiveness across all products and platforms.

        <!-- As a designer for the agency, I recognized the importance of visual identity and brand positioning in attracting new clients and maintaining a competitive edge in the industry. With this in mind, I undertook a comprehensive redesign project aimed at giving the agency a fresh new look that truly reflected their position as a leader in the industry.

To accomplish this, I began by conducting a thorough analysis of the agency's existing branding and design elements, identifying areas where improvements could be made. Drawing on my experience and knowledge of design principles and trends, I crafted a new visual identity that was both modern and sophisticated, while still reflecting the agency's core values and mission.

The resulting design was a beautiful and cohesive system that included a new logo, color scheme, typography, and graphic elements, all of which worked together seamlessly to create a unified brand image. The new design was then implemented across all the agency's marketing collateral, from business cards to website design, creating a consistent and professional look that helped to differentiate the agency from its competitors.

The success of the new design was quickly apparent, as the agency began to receive positive feedback from clients and stakeholders alike. More importantly, the new design helped to attract new buyers to the company, further establishing the agency as a leader in the industry. As a designer, I was proud to have played a key role in this project, and to have contributed to the ongoing success of the agency. -->

          <p class="text-line-length">As a designer, it is my responsibility to minimize the cognitive effort required of users when they interact with a website or digital product. Intuitive navigation, clear site structure, and a user-friendly interface are critical factors in ensuring a seamless user experience. If users encounter confusion or uncertainty about how the system works, it can impede their ability to move through the product effectively. My goal as a designer is to eliminate any ambiguity or confusion and ensure that users have as few questions as possible about how to use the system.</p>
          <p class="text-line-length">To ensure that I create effective and impactful designs, I make use of various design principles and tools. Firstly, I adhere to and apply <a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/gestalt-principles">Gestalt design principles</a>, which help me to create designs that are visually pleasing, well-organized, and easy to understand. I also incorporate <a href="https://growth.design/psychology">Cognitive Biases & Principles</a> to create designs that elicit specific emotions and actions from users. Additionally, I follow <a href="https://lawsofux.com/">The Laws of UX</a>, which provide guidelines for designing intuitive and effective user experiences.</p>
          <p class="text-line-length">In addition, I prioritize accessibility standards in my designs to ensure that they are usable and accessible to every user, regardless of their ability, device, or location.</p>
